## Description

This online e-commerce site is a take on an Amazon clone. Instead of completely copying Amazon we have decided to take some design layouts as an insiration and create our own little e-commerce website. Our site took the name of Congo, which is another rainforest and has taken color themes from the rainforest to help with the user experience. You can create a user account and freely explore the functionality of our site and create mock orders. Happy Shopping!

## Usage

For this website we have implemented a MongoDb for our users, carts, and products. To signup for an account you can click the Login/Signup button and create an account. <span style="color:red; font-style: italic">DO NOT PROVIDE REAL CREDIT CARD INFO</span>. We have limited the card number section to only allow 4 digit card numbers. This site is only used as a demo, no real transactions take place, transaction processing times are only simulated. These functions would be added if there were real e-commerce transactions expected.

Once you go through creating your account you can login, and start browsing our mock site. Search based off of category and text are supported in our search bar. The categories are auto generated by the data received from the db, so it should reflect the current categories provided in our products db. Once you fill out your search parameters you can click the search icon and it will lookup the products in the db.

To access more info on a specific product simply click on the image and you will be taken to a more in depth product details page. From this page you can see more photos, a description and add a specific quantity to your cart.

```
If you are not logged in your cart will be saved using a cookie. Once you login, however, that cart will be added to your user specific cart and deleted from your local device. This will ensure you can access this cart from anywhere.
```

When you have finished finding and selecting products you can proceed to the checkout page. This is accessed from the cart page, and by clicking checkout. You will then be taken through prompts to confirm your shipping and payment info and then the final amount. Once you click Place Order, it will simulate your payment being processed, after 5 seconds it will confirm your order with an order #. During this time it is calling a sample email provided called Nodemailer, and sending a dummy email to the users email. <span style="font-style: italic"> **Note: an email actually does not get sent to your email, it is using a third party service to just replicate an email being sent. You will not receive an email from Congo</span>
